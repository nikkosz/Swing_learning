# Swing_learning
Just Java swing learning and testing
Feel free to use it or do whatever with it.
The thing is it's mostly without any comments because I mostly know what I meant when I was coding it all, I also know it can be hard to read it as it is.
So if the comments will be needed I'm going to make those in my free time.
And remember it's just learning stuff, what it means is it's not a production grade code or anything like that.
It's just pure studying thing.
